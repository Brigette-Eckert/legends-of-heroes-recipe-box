#User Stories

```
1. As a user, I want to see only the title of each recipe when I first visit the page
2. As a user, I want to click a recipe's title to see its other details; like the ingredients and instructions.
3. As a user, I want to be able to hide a recipe's details when I'm done viewing them.
4. As a user, I want to edit my recipes if I need to. I'd like to see changes reflected live on the page as I make them.
